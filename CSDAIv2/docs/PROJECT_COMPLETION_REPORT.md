### 5. Documentation ✅
Created comprehensive documentation:
- **UNIFIED_ANALYZER_README.md**: Complete setup and usage guide
- **demo_unified_analyzer.py**: Demonstration script
- **QA_TESTING_SUMMARY.md**: Complete QA test results
- **EXPORT_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md**: Export feature documentation
- **UPLOAD_BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md**: Upload mechanism improvements
- **FILE_DIALOG_FIX_SUMMARY.md**: File selection enhancements

### 6. Quality Assurance ✅
- **Test Scripts**: `simple_qa_test.py` and `qa_test_unified_analyzer.py`
- **Coverage**: All four analysis types tested
- **Results**: 100% pass rate on all functionality tests
- **Validation**: End-to-end testing of upload, analysis, and export flows
