- Host access validation prevents unauthorized usage
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import errors**: Ensure all required files are in the same directory
2. **API errors**: Verify OpenAI API key and endpoint configuration
3. **File upload errors**: Check file size (max 16MB) and format (.log, .txt)
4. **Parse errors**: Ensure log file is in standard DS agent format

### Debug Mode:
Set `FLASK_DEBUG=True` in `.env` for detailed error messages.
