But please note the following details which are not fully explained in the doc:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>When you are in Developer Console and in the &quot;Permission&quot; page to pick the scopes, please only choose the section &quot;Jira API&quot; by clicking on its &quot;Add&quot; button and then proceed to click its &quot;Configure&quot; button to choose its scopes. If you accidentally add other products (such as &quot;User Identity API&quot;), it would confuse the &quot;Authorization URL generator&quot; and then it would give you the wrong generated URL. Please refrain from doing that. If you accidentally add the wrong scopes form unrelated products, please remove them from &quot;Permission&quot; page using the &quot;Configure&quot; button.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>There is a <strong><span style="color: rgb(255,86,48);">known issue/bug</span></strong> in developer console: If you select items from multiple &quot;API name&quot; items in the list in &quot;Permission&quot; tab, any further calls to REST API would always return empty result. Therefore, for calling Jira REST API, you should only select permissions from the API name &quot;Jira API&quot; in permission setting stage of development console.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Note that if the user is doing it with Jira Cloud site as a testbed, the user needs to provide the complete <strong>Callback URL</strong> such as <a href="https://trendmicro.atlassian.net/jira/your-work">https://trendmicro.atlassian.net/jira/your-work</a> but not just the base URL such as <a href="https://trendmicro.atlassian.net/jira/your-work">https://trendmicro.atlassian.net/</a></p><ol start="1"><li><p>The original design of OAuth 2.0 is that the user's site will send the request to <a href="https://auth.atlassian.com">https://auth.atlassian.com</a> and it would callback to user's own site and return with a &quot;?code=xxx&quot; so the user's site can capture it.</p></li><li><p>This is because when logging in to Jira Cloud (to the base URL), Jira will automatically redirect to the user's default page.</p></li><li><p>In the following OAuth 2.0 set up process, it will append a &quot;?code=xxxx&quot; query string parameter to the result callback URL.</p></li><li><p>But if you only provide the simple base URL, Jira will redirect again to the user's default page and thus the &quot;?code=xxxx&quot; info is lost.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Also note that in the doc it uses the &quot;curl&quot; tool. In the examples the single quote (') is used for quoting the texts. However, single quotes cannot be used in Windows cmd.exe window.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Either do the steps in a Linux / Mac environment. Or</p></li><li><p>In the Windows environment, do it in the Cygwin window.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>After you obtained the &quot;authorization code&quot; and &quot;access token&quot;, you need to proceed to the following steps (<strong>authorization code</strong> =&gt; <strong>access token</strong> =&gt; <strong>cloud-id</strong>) in an hour. If you just keep the info but procrastinate for too long, it will expire and then you need to start over again.</p></li><li><p>Remember at the last step to use the cloud-id, the &quot;Authorization&quot; header and the access token (which token type is &quot;Bearer&quot;) still needs to be provided in REST API code.</p></li><li><p>Please note that the authorization code is valid for only 1 hour, and the access token will be expired in 1 hour as well. In order to use access token for longer than 1 hour:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>In the first step to retrieve the authorization code, add an &quot;<strong>offline_access</strong>&quot; value to the &quot;scope&quot; parameter when using the authorization URL.</p></li><li><p>Each time when the current access token is older than 1 hour, your code needs to send the refresh token request to <a href="http://auth.atlassian.com">auth.atlassian.com</a> so it can return with a new pair of access token and refresh token, and the used refresh token is disabled after its usage.&nbsp; See also: <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#faq1" data-card-appearance="inline">https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#faq1</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; How do I get a new access token, if my access token expires or is revoked.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>Using OAuth 2.0 authentication is preferred because the generated tokens are automatically expired with a given period. (default: unused expire in 3 months and all expire in 1 year)</p><p>Note that for all the following &quot;methods&quot; if OAuth 2.0 is used, use the &quot;<a href="https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloud-id}"><strong>https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloud-id}</strong></a>&quot; as the actual method URL base, for example &quot;<a href="https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloud-id}/rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}">https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloud-id}/rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}</a>&quot; . The cloud-id is what you obtain from the above &quot;oauth-2-3lo-apps&quot; doc in the final step.&nbsp;</p><h1>To authorize with API token</h1><p>Go to Jira cloud site, open avatar =&gt; Manage account =&gt; Security =&gt; API token / Create and manage API tokens =&gt; Create API Token</p><p>Type a label, for example &quot;For testing REST API&quot;. However, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to give it a more specific label which explains the purpose of such token.</p><p>Choose an expiry date. The default would be 7 days from the current date, and the maximum is 1 year from that.</p><p>Click &ldquo;Create&rdquo; =&gt; Copy the newly generated token value.</p><p>Paste the text string to a text file and save it to a safe place for later use. (this is important because it can only copied once)</p><p>Click &quot;Close&quot;</p><p>Use the generated text string in the HTTP request Authorization header in the format: &quot;Basic xxxxxxxxx&quot;</p><ul><li><p>note that in the Jira Cloud, you should use the email address as account name before generating the basic token like this: &quot;Basic &quot; + BASE64($email + &quot;:&quot; + $api_token)</p></li></ul><p>This method is less favorable because the token will never be expired and InfoSec has concern about that.</p><p>Note that if this authorization approach is used, the base URL of the REST API would remain as the Jira Cloud site base URL, such as &quot;<a href="https://trendmicro.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}">https://trendmicro.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}</a>&quot;</p><h2>Basic authentication no longer allowed</h2><p>Originally you could use the &quot;basic authentication&quot; method by combining the account name and password this way</p><ul><li><p>Authorization: &quot;Basic &quot; + BASE64($account + &quot;:&quot; + $password)</p></li></ul><p>However, such methodology was deprecated and removed since 2019, now its usage is totally blocked.

The following pseudo code / steps aim to help explaining how it works.</p><p>First of all, please bear in mind that it is to grant the authorization between the third-party application/site (APP) and Jira Cloud site (JIRA). The following explanation uses USER / APP / JIRA as legends thusly.</p><ul><li><p>USER: <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/" data-card-appearance="inline">https://developer.atlassian.com/</a> </p></li></ul><p>to enable / set up the OAuth 2.0</p><ul><li><p>USER: <a href="https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize?audience=api.atlassian.com&amp;client_id={CLIENT-ID}&amp;scope={SCOPES}&amp;redirect_uri={CALLBACK-URL}&amp;state=${YOUR_USER_BOUND_VALUE}&amp;response_type=code&amp;prompt=consent">https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize?audience=api.atlassian.com&amp;client_id={CLIENT-ID}&amp;scope={SCOPES}&amp;redirect_uri={CALLBACK-URL}&amp;state=${YOUR_USER_BOUND_VALUE}&amp;response_type=code&amp;prompt=consent</a></p></li></ul><p>The above URL can be copied from the Developer console / Authorization page. Note that the CALLBACK-URL should be the URL of the APP.</p><ul><li><p>JIRA =&gt; APP: GET <a href="https://APP/jira/your-work?code={AUTH-CODE}&amp;state=%24%7BYOUR_USER_BOUND_VALUE%7D">https://APP/jira/your-work?code={AUTH-CODE}&amp;state=%24%7BYOUR_USER_BOUND_VALUE%7D</a></p></li></ul><p>Note that the &quot;YOUR_USER_BOUND_VALUE&quot; actually should be a user ID your APP site can associate to the user, which should be entered in JIRA's Developer console and be recognized by your APP site, normally an email address. But if your APP sites uses certain ID or even just ignore it, it still works.</p><p>The APP site should extract the AUTH-CODE from &quot;code=&quot; parameter for such user, and then pops up a window asking the user to provide the client ID and client secret, which are available in Developer console / Settings page.</p><ul><li><p>APP =&gt; JIRA: POST <a href="https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token">https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Payload: {&quot;grant_type&quot;: &quot;authorization_code&quot;,&quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;{CLIENT-ID}&quot;,&quot;client_secret&quot;: &quot;{CLIENT-SECRET}&quot;,&quot;code&quot;: &quot;{AUTH-CODE}&quot;,&quot;redirect_uri&quot;: &quot;{CALLBACK-URL}&quot;}'<br /></p></li><li><p>JIRA =&gt; APP: {&quot;access_token&quot;:&quot;{ACCESS-TOKEN}&quot;,&quot;scope&quot;:&quot;{SCOPES}&quot;,&quot;expires_in&quot;:3600,&quot;token_type&quot;:&quot;Bearer&quot;}</p></li></ul><p>The app should extract the access token for later usage, it will expire in 1 hour (but it should be long enough to execute all the consequent REST API calls in the &quot;batch&quot;).</p><ul><li><p>Extra step only for the first time, in order to obtain the client-id which is the ID list of the target Jira Cloud sites</p></li><li><p>APP =&gt; JIRA: GET <a href="https://api.atlassian.com/oauth/token/accessible-resources">https://api.atlassian.com/oauth/token/accessible-resources</a></p></li><li><p>Header: Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS-TOKEN}</p></li><li><p>Header: Accept: application/json</p></li><li><p>JIRA =&gt; APP: [{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;{CLOUD-ID1}&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;{URL1}&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;{NAME1}&quot;,&quot;scopes&quot;:[{SCOPES}],&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;{AVATAR-URL1}&quot;} ...]<br /></p></li></ul><p>The reason for doing this is because it is possible to register the same OAuth APP for multiple Jira sites, thus we need to know the ID of each Jira site. The result of this REST API call is a list of available IDs, each would map to a Jira Cloud site such that OAuth authorization can access to. The APP should memorize the mapping for following step, which is the final actions your app normally would do to communicate with Jira. This final step can execute many REST API calls for querying / updating Jira data, for as long as the access token is still valid.</p><ul><li><p>Do a REST API call within the &quot;batch&quot; (all GET / PUT / POST methods are available depending on the needs)</p></li><li><p>APP =&gt; JIRA: GET <a href="https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{CLOUD-ID}/rest/api/3/search?jql=project=PROJ">https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{CLOUD-ID}/rest/api/3/search?jql=project=PROJ</a></p></li><li><p>Header: Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS-TOKEN}</p></li><li><p>Header: Accept: application/json</p></li><li><p>When done, loop to do another request with the access token.</p></li></ul><p>Note that all the above should be done within an hour. If your code needs to continuously call REST API with the access token for more than 1 hour, please obtain a &quot;refresh token&quot; for such purpose: <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#faq1" data-card-appearance="inline">https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#faq1</a> </p><p>Ad demonstration code on how this can be done is here:</p><p><ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="[JIRA Cloud]How to reuse and refresh OAuth2.0 access token" ri:version-at-save="2" /><ac:link-body>[JIRA Cloud]How to reuse and refresh OAuth2.0 access token</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><h1>What if the refresh token is expired</h1><p>See this document for details:<br /><ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="[JIRA Cloud]How to renew OAuth app if its refresh token is expired" ri:version-at-save="4" /><ac:link-body>[JIRA Cloud]How to renew OAuth app if its refresh token is expired</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><h1>How to delete OAuth 2.0 app when no longer needed</h1><p>Log in to Jira cloud site</p><p>Avatar =&gt; Manage account =&gt; Connected apps / Apps with access to your accounts</p><p>Choose the &quot;app&quot; and then click its &quot;Remove access&quot;</p><p>Log in to Developer console: <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/" data-card-appearance="inline">https://developer.atlassian.com/</a> </p><p>Avatar =&gt; Developer console =&gt; select app =&gt; Settings =&gt; Delete app =&gt; Delete</p><h1>How to delete OAuth 2.0 app which were added/installed after Feb 2024</h1><p>Note that starting from Feb 2024, after &ldquo;Remove access&rdquo; step the app can still not be deleted from developer console, which is due to the following change in Jira:</p><p><a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/#CHANGE-1409" data-card-appearance="inline">https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/#CHANGE-1409</a> </p><p>Although the change is to fix permission-grant sync process out of sync problem, it brings a new problem that the site no longer has the authorization info and thus the app needs to be explicitly found at the site first and uninstall it from there.
