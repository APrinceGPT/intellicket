What is Intellicket?

Intellicket is an intelligent cybersecurity support platform that transforms how customers get help with Trend Micro Deep Security products. Instead of waiting days for support analysis, customers can now get instant AI-powered diagnostics and often resolve issues themselves in minutes.

The Problem We Solve
- Traditional Support: Submit ticket → Wait for analyst → Multiple back-and-forth → Days to resolution
- Intellicket Solution: Describe issue → AI analysis → Instant diagnosis → Self-resolve or enhanced escalation
